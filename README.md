# git-promp-style

`git-prompt.sh` is the my old look and the wrong way to edit it, because git bash stop to received the updates.

The right way to create a style for the git bash prompt is using the command `code ~/.bashrc` and edit the file. This will generate a new styled prompt and this file we can edit whitout any problem.
